# Space Badge Rebalance (Spore)

Rebalances the progression of Spore's space stage badges.

### This mod will not work on existing galaxies! You need to reset to use this mod.

# Changes

Badge balance has been tweaked, with the easiest being harder and the hardest being easier.
 - These aren't the fun ones like "kill Grox". These are things like "do fetch quests". Who wants to do that?

The values of some badges have been changed.
 - Badges are now consistently worth +30, +40, or +50 for the main badges. Planet Artiste and hidden badges are exceptions.
 - Some badges have the same requirements, so they are simply worth less/more points respectively.
 - Hidden badges are now worth points. Spoilers at the bottom.
 - In total, 1000 badge points are now available.

Titles have been extended so that title 10 includes every single badge.
 - Actual gameplay is very, very similar, with the first five ranks providing you with posse and gameplay changes.
 - Some events may occur slightly later because of this compression.

Ranks have been renamed to actually make some sense.
 - It's rather upsetting to gain the rank of "Omnipotent" and then be blown up by some backwater planet.
 - The first 5 are military ranks, the next 2 are political titles, and the last 3 are empire titles.

Ranks:

0. Pilot (Captain's Badge -> Pilot's Badge)
1. Commander @ 15
2. Captain @ 50
3. Commodore @ 105
4. Admiral @ 180
5. Fleet Admiral @ 275
6. World Leader @ 385
7. Celebrated @ 510
8. Renowned @ 650
9. Great @ 800
10. Legendary @ 1000

Compression Consequences:
 - You are asked to contact the Grox @ 180 (not @ 140) badge points.
 - You are asked to make alliances @ 105 (not @ 75) badge points.
 - You are asked to declare war by NPCs @ 50 (not @ 30) badge points.
 - Every rank boosts your mission rewards. With fewer ranks, mission rewards aren't often as high.
 - Every rank reduces your mission time. With fewer ranks, mission times aren't often as short.
 - Ranks past rank 5 give a greater boost than you could ever get, up to 2x what the base game offers.

In the base game, only 856 badge points can be obtained. By tweaking a few things, this has been boosted to 1000.
- -15: Planet Artiste now totals 15, not 30.
- -15: Colonist now totals to 30, not 45.
- +15: Traveler now totals 30, not 15.
- +20: Brain Surgeon now totals 50, not 30.
- +10: Wonderland Wanderer now totals to 40 points, not 30.
- +09: Zoologist now totals 40, not 31.
- +07: Warmonger now totals 30, not 23.
- +05: Conquerer now totals 50, not 45.
- +05: Economist now totals 50, not 45.
- +04: Terra-Wrangler now totals 40, not 36.
- -01: Captain's badge now worth 0 points, not 1.
- +100: All hidden achievements are now worth 100 in total.

Some of the most difficult badges are rather boring. These have their maximum requirements reduced.
- Wonderland Wanderer now requires 10 storybook planets for badge 5 (rather than 12). There are only 10 different types, so this way it is impossible to see everything and still not get the badge.
- Gopher and Cleaner now require 50 missions for badge 5 (rather than 70).
- Eco Hero now requires 35 rescues for badge 5 (rather than 50).
- Gopher and Cleaner now require 35 missions for badge 4 (rather than 40).
- Eco Hero now requires 20 rescues for badge 4 (rather than 25).

Warmonger is surprisingly light, so this will be *increased*.
- Warmonger now requires 25 wars for badge 5 (rather than 25).
- Warmonger now requires 15 wars for badge 4 (rather than 10).
- Warmonger now requires 7 wars for badge 3 (rather than 6).

Colonist and Conquerer were also considered for being increased, but these would disrupt the item distribution too much, since they both unlock a lot of key items between them.

Since there are 7 times, at least, you may want to change archetype, Split Personality 5 now requires 7 changes.
